# 🧮 Tabish Calculator  
> “Numbers are not relevant.”  

### A Fun HTML Project 🤪

This is a lighthearted calculator built purely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — but with a twist.  
It looks serious, feels smooth, and proudly gives **absolutely wrong results** every single time.  

Because why should math have all the rules?
